# Robots in Grasshopper
ðŸ¤– + ðŸ¦—

A collection of plugins and software that can be used to control industrial robots with Grasshopper in Rhinoceros3D.
### Compiled by [Robin Godwyll](github.com/robin-gdwl)  
**Work in Progress**. [Raise an Issue](https://github.com/boundlessmaking/Robots-in-Grasshopper/issues) or pull request if a plugin is missing or information is incorrect.   
Not all Plugins have been tested by me. Use at your own Risk.   
The list tries to sort the plugins by accessibility (price, robot brands supported, open-source), It is not a ranking in functionality or quality.
